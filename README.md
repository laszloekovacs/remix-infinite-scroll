# Infinite scrolling with remix fetcher

[![Remix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Remix-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=Remix&logoColor=FFFFFF&logoWidth=14)](https://remix.run)

## Notes
- ⚠️ The project is deployed on a raspberry pi with docker, it might go down due to overheating
- if on initial load the app does not overflow the screen, the loader does not work
- it seems the fetcher overfetches when the window is getting resized

## Example
